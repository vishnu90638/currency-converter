The currency converter web app developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to convert between different currencies in real-time. It fetches exchange rates from a public API and calculates conversions based on user-input amounts and selected currencies. The interface includes input fields for amount and currency selection, with a button to trigger the conversion. Upon clicking the "Convert" button, the app retrieves the latest exchange rates, computes the converted amount, and displays it dynamically on the page. This app is designed to be run directly in a web browser or integrated into a web development environment like Visual Studio Code for testing and further development.
